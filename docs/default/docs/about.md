# About

Write a single code in C++ for the business logic with Nativium and compile for any platform.

You don't need rewrite your application because the generated binary can be attached to an existing application.

Supported platforms:

- Linux
- macOS
- Windows
- iOS
- tvOS
- watchOS
- macCatalyst
- Web Assembly (WASM)

Only need write platform-specific code where itâ€™s necessary .For example, to implement a native user-interface or when working with platform-specific code, like get device battery level.

## Why i need use it?

Some projects require a single business logic code for multiple platforms instead of write a code for each platform.

A native code in C++ is very secure and has a better performance than others languages.

This project is your best option, because it is ready for this purpose and is ready for production without any efforts.

## I need make my project in C++?

No, you can "plug" the binary generated by Nativium into a new or existing application (mobile, desktop or web).

You don't need write your entire mobile, desktop or web application in C++, but "plug" only the part that you want share between all platforms.

Generally user-interface is made with platform tools or code (Swift, Kotlin etc) and the business logic or the heavy processing was made with C++.

## It is paid?

No, you can use it for free, for any purpose, including commercial purposes.

Feel free to collaborate improving the main project or modules.
